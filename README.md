## Features

 - Designed for Mirror Dungeon 5
 - Picks team with best rest bonus
 - Configurable teams through TeamConfig.csv

## Notes

Only really tested on 1920 x 1080p. There's some code to try and scale images and positions, but it might not work too well.

# Insallation

## Windows

Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/LocandLoad/P-EnterBot`

Download Python 3.12 >= if needed

Install requirements `python3.12 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Usage

`python3.12 P-EnterBot.py --runs (run count) --team (index of team in TeamConfig.csv)`

If a run count is not provided through the programs arguments, it will ask for a run count upon launch.

the `--team` argument is only intended to be used if you have to restart / start the program in the middle of a Mirror Dungeon run. Otherwise, the program will pick the team with the best rest bonus and use that.

Pressing `q` in the terminal window will stop the program.

## Team Configuration

The top of the CSV file should have the headers `TeamRow,Type,Sinner1,Sinner2,Sinner3,Sinner4,Sinner5,Sinner6,Sinner7,Sinner8,Sinner9,Sinner10,Sinner11,Sinner12`.

After that each row should contain, the row number in the game the team is on "Team #n", the status of the team (Burn, Bleed, Slash, etc.), and then the deployment order of the sinners (Gregor, HongLu, YiSang, etc.).

An example configuration would look like this,

```csv
TeamRow,Type,Sinner1,Sinner2,Sinner3,Sinner4,Sinner5,Sinner6,Sinner7,Sinner8,Sinner9,Sinner10,Sinner11,Sinner12
1,Burn,Gregor,Outis,YiSang,Faust,Sinclair,Don,Ishmael,Meursault,HongLu,Ryoshu,Rodya,Heathcliff
2,Bleed,Don,Rodya,Heathcliff,Ishmael,Outis,Gregor,YiSang,Ryoshu,Faust,Sinclair,Meursault,HongLu
3,Charge,Ryoshu,Outis,Don,Heathcliff,Ishmael,Gregor,Sinclair,YiSang,Faust,Meursault,HongLu,Rodya
7,Poise,Meursault,YiSang,HongLu,Faust,Don,Heathcliff,Outis,Sinclair,Gregor,Rodya,Ishmael,Ryoshu
```
